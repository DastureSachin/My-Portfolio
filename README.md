Notes for you:
- Replace placeholders (tech stack, demo URL, screenshots, projects, run commands) with real data from your project.
- If you'd like, I can update the README to include an auto-generated Projects section by scanning the repo, add badges, or add a better installation guide — tell me which you'd like and I can update the file.
